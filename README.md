# Crack Detection Model

This repository contains a deep learning model designed for crack detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is built with TensorFlow and Keras, and it is trained to identify cracks in images with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Model Architecture**: Utilizes a custom CNN model with advanced techniques for crack detection.
- **Training**: Trained on a dataset of images with corresponding binary mask annotations.
- **Performance**: Achieves high accuracy (up to 99%) on test data.
- **Quantization**: Optionally supports model quantization for reduced file size and efficient inference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

Install the required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
